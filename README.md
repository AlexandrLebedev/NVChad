##  PHP Environment Configuration

If you're working locally and need to define specific PHP rules (e.g., for Intelephense), create an `intelephense.json` file in the root of your project.

###  Example: `intelephense.json`

```json
{
  "environment": {
    "phpVersion": "7.4",
    "shortOpenTag": false
  },
  "files": {
    "exclude": [
      "**/.git/**",
      "**/.svn/**",
      "**/.hg/**",
      "**/node_modules/**",
      "**/vendor/**",
      "**/runtime/**",
      "**/web/assets/**",
      "**/console/migrations/**.php"
    ]
  }
}
```
